                    <p class="myBio">My name is Chad Prybell and I was born in 1995 in Virginia! I then moved to the Chicago-land area where I spent the next 12 years of my life, before finally settling down in the Seattle area. I graduated from Skyline highschool in 2013.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="myBio">I attended the University of Washington begginning in the fall of 2013. When I first attended I was pre-engineering track, but I had no idea what I really wanted to study. After 2 years I decided I like Electrical Engineering, and I applied to study this. I got accepted to the EE school at UW and I graduated with my Bachelor's in Science in the summer of 2017</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="myBio">After graduating from college I took a few months off from school and work while I searchedd for a full time job. In October of 2017 I begin at an Aero-space company called Astronics AES located in Kirkland Washington. Here I am an integration engineer. I work on integrating multiple units together and testing the units! I have decided that I like coding better though, so I am currently taking this bootcamp to try and become a software/web developer!</p>
